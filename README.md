# Tic_Tac_Toe
This script allows two players to play Tic-Tac-Toe against each other in the console. It demonstrates fundamental Python concepts such as functions, loops, conditional statements, and list manipulation.


This is a simple yet complete implementation of the classic two-player game, Tic-Tac-Toe, designed to be played from the command line. The project is a great example of a beginner-friendly application that showcases fundamental Python programming concepts in a clear and organized manner.

**Key Features - **

Game Board: The game board is represented as a list, which is a perfect data structure for this kind of grid-based game. It is displayed in a user-friendly format in the console.

Two-Player Mode: The game facilitates a match between two players, "X" and "O," taking turns to make their moves.

Input Validation: The program ensures that players enter a valid number (1-9) for their move and that the selected position on the board is not already taken.

Win and Tie Detection: The code includes functions to check for all possible winning conditions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) and to determine if the game has ended in a tie.

Modular Design: The project is structured with clear, well-named functions for creating the board, displaying it, checking for wins, and handling player moves. This makes the code easy to read, understand, and maintain.


**How to Play -**
The game will display the board and prompt "Player X, enter your move (1-9): ". Each number corresponds to a position on the board, like a keypad. For example, entering 1 places your mark in the top-left corner, and 9 places it in the bottom-right.
